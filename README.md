## Background

**Source of Data**: https://redplanetscience.com/ 

* Basic Web Scraping is Done from several urls above to obtain images and mars facts:*

* Initial Scraping is done in Jupyter Notebook and later converted into python script
* Once script is generated, we write Flask App to automate scraping and store data into Mongo DB
* Once data is stored Flask is used to write data into html for display


## Requirements

1. Scripting: **Python Scripting**
2. Notebook: **Jupyter Notebook**
3. Libraries used: **pandas, Flask, create_engine, time**
4. Libraries used: **Beautiful Soup, PyMongo**
